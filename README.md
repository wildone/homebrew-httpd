Homebrew-HTTPd
==============

Apache HTTP Server formulae repo for Homebrew

##Background
I wanted to upgrade Lion's version of Apache to 2.4 to check out some of the new features, but there wasn't a good formula out there yet. So I created my own, put it up here for the world to tap into, and that's all I have to say about that.

##Installation
Run the following in your commandline:

	brew tap jabberwik/homebrew-httpd

Then install Apache HTTP Server 2.4:

	brew install httpd24
	
That's it!

This is my first formula contribution to the world, so let me know if I did something completely backwards. Contributions are welcomed!
